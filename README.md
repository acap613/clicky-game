# clicky-game
React based memory game: 12 characters from classic video games are shuffled randomly into position, click a pic you HAVEN'T clicked
and get a point. Every time you score a point the board reshuffles to keep you on your toes! Try and get all 12...

Start by simply clicking a picture!

# About this code
this code was predominantly created using "npx create-react-app clicky-game" in node as well as downloading a few extra npm packages.
What I did, outside manipulating the CSS/Bootstrap for design purposes, was create some components folders, and then programmed the App.js to include the components, shuffle logic, and picture ids. A cool feature in this is that the pictures are stored in a JSON file so that any number of "cards" may be added if, for instance, you wanted to make this a game that plays to 20, or 50 or what ever (there are a lot of characters from Smash-Bros I didn't include...).
