# About this code
this code was predominantly created using "npx create-react-app clicky-game" in node as well as downloading a few extra npm packages.
the only coding I did, outside the CSS/Bootstrap for design purposes, was create the components folders, and of course fleshed out the App.js to include the components, shuffle logic, and picture ids.
